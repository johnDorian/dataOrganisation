\section{Introduction}
The data obtained from the Sydeny Catchment Authority (SCA) has a continuos discharge data set starting early 1960 and ending in 2009. The water quality dataset currently being used was supplied mid 2008. This dataset starts in 1991 and ends in 2008. This dataset is heavily biased with the starting of this dataset, being only collected via routine and flood, samples. This bias leads to the belief that the data in the early part of the data set has missed several key events.
